# tinygl

A lightweight OpenGL renderer created with C++.
It is not production ready, has bugs and no real abstraction from OpenGL when accessing the API.

It was made for the educational value and I do not expect to work on it specifically unless I need it for another project.

# Building

```
  cmake --build /path/to/tinygl/build --target tinygl
```
